          <h2>About me!</h2>
          <p>
         Hi all! My name is Nyah Marshall, I am a news fellow at Advance Local Media. Through the fellowship, I work full-time as a breaking and local news reporter at NJ Advance Media, also known as, NJ.com. At NJ.com, I produce compelling stories that resonate with communities in New Jersey. Iâ€™m also working towards completing my masterâ€™s degree in journalism innovation at Syracuse University and am constantly learning about the latest in the world of journalism. I recently gradated from Howard University where I majored journalism and minored in African-American studies. I a multimedia journalist, that has contributed to several Howard affiliated news publications, including HU News Service, Truth Be Told, 101Magazine and WHBC Radio Station. I've interned at the Black News Channel, for the show Amplified, hosted by political strategist Aisha Mills. My reporting highlights include covering the White House, during Vice President Harrisâ€™ Project SERV announcement, and the judiciary senate hearings, during day three of Judge Ketanji Brown Jacksonâ€™s confirmation hearings. 
               </p>
           <p>
            Through studying at Howard, I became fascinated with the influences the early Black press had on the Black community. Like the Black press, I'm passionate about sharing other peopleâ€™s stories, being an advocate for social change and to quote the founders of the first Black newspaper, Freedomâ€™s Journal, I wish to plead my own cause. With this inspiration in mind, I founded UnitedStories, â€”a journalism based media platform that will revive the roles of the early Black press by priding itself in advocacy journalism.
